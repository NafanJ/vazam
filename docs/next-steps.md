# Vazam — Status & Next Steps

*Snapshot: June 2026. Companion to [data-acquisition-plan.md](data-acquisition-plan.md).
This is the "where were we?" doc — read this first when picking the project back up.*

## Where things stand

The full accuracy roadmap from the scaling deep-dive is **built, tested, and pushed**
(127 backend tests + 4 app tests passing):

| Piece | Status | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Consensus voice scraper (replaces blind first-hit) | ✅ | `scrape_audio.py`, `consensus.py` |
| Multi-window verification on `identify()` | ✅ | `pipeline.py` (`split_windows`, `window_agreement`) |
| Accuracy benchmark harness | ✅ | `eval.py`, `benchmark/README.md` |
| Cast-graph show inference (zero-input show-aware search) | ✅ | `pipeline.identify_show`, `POST /identify/show` |
| Channel augmentation of scraped references | ✅ | `augment.py`, folded in by the scraper |
| Mobile client + UI wiring for show inference | ✅ | `app/src/api/vazam.ts`, `HomeScreen`, `ResultsScreen` |
| App toolchain (install / lint / typecheck / test) | ✅ | `app/` configs |
| CLAUDE.md matches reality | ✅ | repo root |

**What the system is:** FastAPI backend (all the intelligence) + React Native mobile app.
There is no web frontend, but the backend's Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8000/docs`
is a full test surface — the app is not needed to exercise anything.

**Mobile app caveat:** `app/` has source, tests, and configs but **no `ios/` or
`android/` native project folders** — it cannot be built onto a phone yet. Generating
the native scaffolding is its own task (see below).

## To run it (one-time setup)

0. **System FFmpeg** — `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`. yt-dlp needs it to extract
   MP3 audio in the scraper, and MP3 decoding needs it too. WAV/FLAC/OGG decode
   without it (soundfile backend), so the API/eval paths work, but the scraper
   does not until FFmpeg is present. Verify with `ffmpeg -version`.
   Note: `requirements.txt` pins `torch/torchaudio < 2.6` and `pyannote.audio < 4`
   on purpose — newer releases route audio I/O through torchcodec, which breaks on
   CPU-only boxes. Don't loosen those bounds without testing audio decode.
1. **Apply migrations** — run `migrations/000_base_schema.sql` then
   `001_embedding_quality.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor (or they're already
   applied to the current project via MCP). Inserts fail without them.
2. **`.env` in repo root:** `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY` (service role),
   `HF_TOKEN` (free HF token). Accept terms for **all three** gated pyannote repos
   — they are separate gates: `hf.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1` and
   `hf.co/pyannote/segmentation-3.0` (diarization → scraping + show inference) **and**
   `hf.co/pyannote/segmentation` (the *original* — powers VAD, used by single-speaker
   `identify()` to trim to speech). Missing the last one doesn't error loudly: VAD
   silently falls back to embedding the whole clip, which tanks `identify()` accuracy
   (measured: 0.88 → 0.10 on the same clip). Without `HF_TOKEN` entirely the system
   degrades further: no diarization → no show inference, weaker scraping.
3. **Start + seed + scrape:**

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/uvicorn api:app --reload      # → http://localhost:8000/docs
   python seed.py --show "Cowboy Bebop"    # cast metadata from AniList
   python scrape_audio.py --actor "Steve Blum" --force   # sanity-check one actor
   python scrape_audio.py --limit 20       # rest of the cast
   ```

   First scrape downloads models; CPU diarization is minutes per actor — start small.
4. **Test in the browser:** `/docs` → `POST /identify` with any clip;
   `POST /identify/show` with a two-character scene.

## Live validation (June 2026) — proven end-to-end on real data

The pipeline has now been run for real, not just unit-tested. Current Supabase
project (`rpmcsbgtsvpoczpycozr`) holds **8 consensus embeddings**: Steve Blum +
7 of 10 Attack on Titan main-cast seiyuu (Eren/Yuuki Kaji, Mikasa→miss,
Armin/Marina Inoue, Levi/Hiroshi Kamiya, Hange/Romi Park, Annie/Yuu Shimamura,
Reiner/Yoshimasa Hosoya, Connie/Hiro Shimono; Erwin/Daisuke Ono, Jean/Kishou
Taniyama, Mikasa/Yui Ishikawa did not reach consensus). Quality scores 0.57–0.72.

What the validation runs showed:

- **References are sound.** A *held-out* Yuuki Kaji interview (not a source video)
  matched the stored Kaji embedding at **cosine 0.884**, confidently, with all 3
  verification windows agreeing — impostors sat at ≤0.66 and won zero windows.
- **`identify/show` works on raw anime.** A real AoT scene (Eren↔Mikasa, Japanese,
  no hints) correctly inferred **"Attack on Titan"** via cast co-occurrence
  (2/3 speakers matched). The co-occurrence vote is the robust layer — it locked
  the show even though individual character-voice scores were middling.
- **Open-set gap, quantified:** ~**0.88** on matched-condition audio (interview vs
  interview reference) vs ~**0.52** on character voices (Eren mid-scene vs the
  interview "Natural Voice" reference). This is the concrete argument for storing
  per-character embeddings on marquee roles (the `voice_label` mechanism already
  exists; see Next Steps #4).

Runtime fixes landed this session (all committed/pushed): yt-dlp EJS challenge
solver + shorter download sections (`1f57695`), Japanese-language search queries
`--lang {en,ja,both}` for seiyuu (`ea120f1`), and `isolate_vocals` using
`sys.executable` with graceful fallback (`1816ada`). Dependency pins
(torch/torchaudio <2.6, pyannote <4, huggingface_hub <1) and the VAD gate are
both required and now in place.

**Why 3 AoT leads missed — it's a linking limit, not a search limit.** Re-running
the misses with `--lang both` *did* surface clean solo Japanese interviews, but
their clips diarized to one speaker each and those single embeddings didn't
cluster across videos (cross-video cosine < the 0.60 consensus link threshold —
compressed YouTube audio from different mics drifts apart). Levers: lower the link
threshold (0.60 → ~0.55, A/B for false-links) or augment *before* clustering so
cross-condition takes pull together. Deferred — 7/10 is enough for show inference.

## Next steps (in order)

1. ~~Run the setup and prove the loop on one show.~~ ✅ **Done** (see Live
   validation above — seeded, scraped, and identified end-to-end on real clips).
2. **Record benchmark clips** — the one task only a human can do. ~20 clips per show
   across 3–5 shows, **phone mic pointed at a playing TV, not clean rips**
   (protocol in `benchmark/README.md`). Then:

   ```bash
   python eval.py benchmark/ --json runs/baseline.json
   ```

   Until this exists, every accuracy claim is unmeasured. It also unlocks the A/Bs:
   `eval.py --no-verify` (what verification buys) and re-scraping with
   `--no-augment` (what channel augmentation buys).
3. **Calibrate thresholds from evidence.** `CONFIDENT_THRESHOLD = 0.70` /
   `POSSIBLE_THRESHOLD = 0.50` in `pipeline.py` are uncalibrated guesses; tune them
   against benchmark numbers. Expect them to need raising as the DB grows
   (impostor scores rise with N); consider AS-norm score normalization if precision
   degrades at scale. Also tune the **consensus link threshold** (0.60 in
   `consensus.py`) — it cost 3 AoT leads (see Live validation); try 0.55 and watch
   for false-links.
4. **Per-character embeddings for marquee roles.** Validation measured a real
   ~0.88→0.52 drop from interview "Natural Voice" references to in-character voices.
   The `voice_label` column already supports multiple embeddings per actor — add
   character-voice embeddings lazily for top-billed roles (stays within the plan's
   anti-goal of *not* bulk-scraping character clips). Re-test with `identify/show`
   on the same AoT scene to confirm the lift before scaling.
5. **Data plan build order** (from `data-acquisition-plan.md`):
   entity-resolution schema change (cross-source actor IDs — do first, painful to
   retrofit) → TMDB resolver alongside AniList → `show_ingestion_status` +
   demand-driven background ingestion → overnight warm-start of top shows.
6. **Generate RN native projects** (`ios/`, `android/`) so the app actually builds;
   point the client at the dev machine's LAN IP (`setBaseUrl`) instead of localhost.
7. **Cleanup:** delete or rewrite legacy `main.py` — it still imports FAISS
   (pre-Supabase era) and won't run with current requirements.

## Things to remember

- Audio is gitignored everywhere (benchmark clips, samples) — embeddings only,
  source URLs kept for provenance/takedown.
- Per-character embeddings stay **lazy-only, top-billed-only** (plan anti-goal:
  never bulk-scrape character voices; lean on show-aware search instead).
- Any change that could affect accuracy gets an `eval.py` before/after. No vibes.
